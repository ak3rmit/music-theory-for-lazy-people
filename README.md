First we need to discuss what an halfNote is. A Halfnote is if you one step up on your keyboard
For Example for C one semiTone up is C# etc.

C half C# half  D half D# half E half F half F# half  G half G# half A half A# half B half C'

## Major 
For the Major Scale you pick a root note and go up the tones like this 

Major: whole whole half whole whole whole half 

Let's take C.

Then we have: 
C D E F G A H C

That's C Major
With that method you can pick any node on your keyboard as the root note and play with this sheme and you have your minor Scale.

## Minor 
Let's do this with minor.
Same principles as Major apply besides now you go 

Minor: whole whole whole half whole whole half

C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭
