# music-theory-for-lazy-people
Tired of very complex explained music theory? The basics are much easier then you think!
The good news is that there are only 12 notes that humans find sound pleasing to your ear.

First we need to discuss what an halfNote is. A Halfnote is if you one step up on your keyboard
For Example for C one semiTone up is C# etc.

C half C# half  D half D# half E half F half F# half  G half G# half A half A# half B half C'

## Major 
For the Major Scale you pick a root note and go up the tones like this 

Major: whole whole half whole whole whole half 

Let's take C.

Then we have: 
C D E F G A H C

That's C Major
With that method you can pick any node on your keyboard as the root note and play with this sheme and you have your minor Scale.

## Minor 
Let's do this with minor.
Same principles as Major apply besides now you go 

Minor: whole whole whole half whole whole half

C, D, E♭, F, G, A♭, B♭

## Chords or Triads
Chords or Triads are 3 Tones in a Scale 

e.g C Minor Scale  you just skip one Note of the scale and play them

C Minor Chord
C E♭ G

D Minor
D F A♭
...

Now you can play a little around any chord you play in this scale will now sound good together


## Major Triads

1: Major I

2: Minor ii 

3: Minor iii

4: Major IV

5: Major V

6: Minor vi

7: Diminished(you don't really need that at first)


You often see these Latin Numbers in Musik. They just refer to chord in a scale. Since there are 7 notes in a Scale.
You can now search for a song pick out the chords and play the same relative in the same key over the whole keyboard.


## Inversion

You will jump a lot when playing like this. It often sounds better to just play the same chord slightly higher instead of going to many semitones up. So we can make us of "Inversion"

Let's say we have the C Major Key
C E G 
This chord could also be played as:
E G C
or 
G C E


## Melodie

Often Pentatonics sound good as melodie.
Also often it is good that the melodie ends of an note in the played scale.
Try to remove the 5th and 7th note of a scale. Often sounds really good.


## TO-Do

- Add Phyrigian etc....
- Write out all Scales
- More Images
- How to practice?
- Add 5ths
- Add Subdominance 
- etc...
